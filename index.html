              <p>Concerning the challenge and problem that nearly half of the high school graduates in Arizona do not enter college after graduation, the government is burdened to convert more high school graduates to college students. As a result, a linear programming maximization model was created to find the optimal solution and the projected maximum tax revenue. The main challenges were to find out and make decisions on what relevant input variables to select and how they should be logically related and presented. One particular challenge in the parameter selection stage was to figure out the value of the key parameter"Conversion rate."</p>

              <p>In this seven-week class, a variety of interesting and important topics were covered. These included: Internet of Things, Regression, Machine Learning (classification &amp; clustering algorithms, Deep Learning), Text Mining. In predictive analytics module, specific topics covered included Neural Networks, K-nearest neighbor, Support Vector Machines, and Decisional Trees and its algorithm ramifications. In clustering module, Kohonen SOM and K-Means techniques were discussed. Additional topics covered included, using R to solve machine learning problems, machine learning model evaluation, voting-based ensemble techniques, stack ensemble, cross-validation, feature selection, feature extraction, and gradient boosting, etc. The two main tools used in the course and applied in doing assignments were Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and SPSS Modeler 18.</p>

              <p>In this fourteen-week course, six key topics were studied including Six Sigma principles, Six Sigma Methodology (DMAIC: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control), Statistical Process Control, Process Capability Evaluation, Design of Experiment, and Inferential Statistics (focus on product and process quality). Throughout the semester, four Harvard case studies were analyzed. These four cases included, Samsung Electronics where ...., Morelia Mortgage Company case where, Excel Logistics Services where, and General Micro Electronics, Incorporated case where... </p>

              <p>In this fourteen-week problem-solving course, a variety of advanced analytical techniques derived from management science were examined to improve decision making. Specifically, four overarching deterministic optimization techniques were studied in details and applied in four case studies. These business decisions-supporting techniques included linear programming, nonlinear programming, integer programming; network models and a brief introduction to metaheuristics.</p>
              <p>One of the most valuable experience that this class offered was that, all these models were analyzed for a variety of common business problems across diverse fields such as e-commerce, banking, healthcare, services, telecommunication, transportation, and utilities, among others. Additionally, Implementation of these models was done using Excel——performing spreadsheet modeling and setting up Solver to find the optimal solution, and corresponding Sensitivity report was analyzed for each model to ensure that the optimal solution works in a wide variety of situations (what-if analysis, essentially).</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
          <p>Apart from being a GPA 4.0 student and a part-time student analyst, I enjoy most of my time listening to all kinds of music and watching music videos on Youtube. Believe it or not, I also enjoy playing fidget spinners! I guess that may be because I like mental activity, playing spinners helps me focus and think.</p>
          <p>There are several key words or themes that I sincerely value besides "Career" and "Family", one being Music, one being Music, one being Golden Retriever, and one being Investment. I have been learning how to invest small in stocks and digital currencies.</p>
          <p>I am also the type of person that is introspective and appreciates intellectual discussions. One of my favorite courses I studied was Human Event, where I got to read philosophy classics, learn other intelligent students' ideas and understandings of the world, life and humanity.</p>
          <p>Although I have done well in school, I am attracted to cool things that are not necessarily discussed in class or school. Cool things such as Digital education, Web scraping, <a href = "google.com" target = "_blank">Neuromarketing</a>, Ripple, Blockchain technology, 3D food printer, Autonomous car!</p>
